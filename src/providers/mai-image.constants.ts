/**
 * Shared constants for Microsoft MAI Image (MAI-Image-2.5).

 * Extracted from `mai-image.provider.ts` into their own module so that
 * lightweight consumers (Zod schemas, the Elicitation service, etc.) can
 * depend on just the constants without pulling in the full provider
 * implementation (which itself imports `image-media`, `sanitise`, and the
 * Azure deployment catalog types). Keeping this module free of any other
 * imports also avoids any risk of a circular import between
 * `mai-image.provider.ts` and its consumers.
